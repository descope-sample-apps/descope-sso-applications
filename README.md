# Descope SSO Applications üåê

Descope SSO Applications is designed to simplify the authentication process for employees and other users utilizing [Dynamic Federation](https://www.descope.com/use-cases/identity-federation) and [IdP-initiated SSO](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/idp-vs-sp-sso?_gl=1*m72a5o*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3MTAxODM1MjAuQ2p3S0NBancxN3F2QmhCckVpd0ExclU5dzV0dUFuNm95MG9hRWtVOXpMQkdiVU4ySWI0b0dwS2tHT1o5REl2SGRHbGN4ZTZzaXdMNk9Sb0NBV01RQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_au*MTExNTU5OTU2NS4xNzA2MTI5NTQ5). By acting as a centralized SSO provider, it offers seamless, frictionless sign-in capabilities across multiple SAML SSO-based applications.

## Features / Use Cases ‚ú®

1. **Streamlined Access**: Provide a unified interface for both internal organization and external users to access SAML applications without any friction, leveraging existing login sessions with other SSO providers. üîë
2. **Dynamic Federation**: Authentication requests can be re-routed to any of the SAML SSO providers you've previously configured, allowing you to add multiple IdPs to applications that may only support one IdP, with Descope in the middle guiding your users through to the right provider. üîÑ
3. **Works with Other Auth Providers**: With IdP-initiated SSO, you can add Descope as a layer on top of any current implementation you have (with Auth0, Cognito, Firebase, etc.) to provide you and your users with seamless SAML-based SSO to all of your apps, without changing any app-level SAML configurations. ü§ù
